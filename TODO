PCI presence detect, reset, PME, M66EN (another expander?)
Voltage sense
Full SD interface
Switch all standard resistors to 0402
Catalog all I2C addresses on main bus
    - Label in schematic
    - Label on PCB
I2C max resistance should be 1.4k
    - on buses with S5/S0 capacitance, make sure to note on
        schematic that pullup resistance is half as strong in
        standby, and thus I2C speed should be halved
Another DIP switch: system clock low speed
    - can be used for demoing with no fan
Route all power
Catalog all parts, combine when possible
Reorder sheets
Reannotate (use four-digit numbers)
Arrange silks on PCB
