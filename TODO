JTAG/reset pullups
FPGA SUSPEND pins
CPU handshake lines
Voltage sense
Fix "Error: No footprint defined"
Check footprints: SD, DE9, power
Full SD interface
Switch all standard resistors to 0402
Tidy up LIMB vs EC
Pick a consistent name for active low signals (ideally one that can be used in code)
LIMB ADVREF
CPU power, bank 0
Catalog all I2C addresses on main bus
    - Label in schematic
    - Label on PCB
I2C resistance should be between 900 and 5k
    - bus capacitance too high for 400 kHz; target speed 100 kHz
    - on buses with S5/S0 segments, make sure to note on
        schematic that pullup resistance is half as strong in
        standby, and thus I2C speed should be halved
Another DIP switch: system clock low speed
    - can be used for demoing with no fan
Route all power
Length-tune interfaces
Reorder sheets
Reannotate (use four-digit numbers)
Catalog all parts, combine when possible
Arrange silks on PCB
