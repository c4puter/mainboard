I2C resistance should be between 900 and 5k
    - bus capacitance too high for 400 kHz; target speed 100 kHz
    - on buses with S5/S0 segments, make sure to note on
        schematic that pullup resistance is half as strong in
        standby, and thus I2C speed should be halved
Another DIP switch: system clock low speed
    - can be used for demoing with no fan
FPGA config data: control reflections with a 50 ohm / 10pF AC termination at the end
RTC alarm? linux/Documentation/rtc.txt and the kernel RTC driver
Slave power connector for e.g. SATA
Route all power
Voltage sense
Length-tune interfaces
Finish all pours, add possible stitching?
Reorder sheets
Reannotate (use four-digit numbers)
Catalog all parts, combine when possible
Arrange silks on PCB
